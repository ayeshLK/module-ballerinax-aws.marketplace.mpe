## Overview

[AWS Marketplace Entitlement Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/marketplace/latest/userguide/entitlement.html) is a 
service that allows AWS Marketplace sellers to determine the entitlements of customers who have subscribed to their 
products.

The `ballerinax/aws.marketplace.mpe` package offers APIs to interact with the AWS Marketplace Entitlement Service,
enabling developers to retrieve entitlement data for a product programmatically.

## Setup guide
Before using this connector in your Ballerina application, complete the following:
1. Create an [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup?nc2=h_ct&src=default&redirect_url=https%3A%2F%2Faws.amazon.com%2Fregistration-confirmation#/start)
2. [Obtain tokens](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html)

## Quickstart

To use the `aws.marketplace.mpe` connector in your Ballerina project, modify the `.bal` file as follows:

### Step 1: Import the module

Import the `ballerinax/aws.marketplace.mpe` module into your Ballerina project.

```ballerina
import ballerinax/aws.marketplace.mpe;
```

### Step 2: Instantiate a new connector

Create a new `mpe:Client` by providing the access key ID, secret access key, and the region.

```ballerina
configurable string accessKeyId = ?;
configurable string secretAccessKey = ?;

mpe:Client mpe = check new(region = mpe:US_EAST_1, auth = {
    accessKeyId,
    secretAccessKey
});
```

### Step 3: Invoke the connector operation

Now, utilize the available connector operations.

```ballerina
mpe:EntitlementsResponse response = check mpe->getEntitlements(productCode = "<aws-product-code>");
```

### Step 4: Run the Ballerina application

Use the following command to compile and run the Ballerina program.

```bash
bal run
```
